INSTRUCTIONS

-To move your jet, use W,A,S,D.

-To shot, use the SPACE key button.

-Be aware of the pigeons, they're aggresive.

-The game will get harder as it progresses, the game purpose is to frustrate the player.

-From time to time, an icon of a letter X will appear on the left side of the screen, it's a booster that cleans the whole screen from pigeons. It will stay until
picked up, so you can save it for a dangerous moment.

-You can exit the game whenever you want by pressing the ESC button.
